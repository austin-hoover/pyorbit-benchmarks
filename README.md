# PyORBIT benchmarks

This repository is a collection of accelerator physics simulations to benchmark [PyORBIT](https://github.com/PyORBIT-Collaboration/PyORBIT3) against other codes. The plan is to start from simple situations like drifts, FODO lattices, etc. and build up to more complicated simulations. This is a work in progress, and contributions or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an Issue on GitHub or email one of the contacts below:

## Contacts

* Austin Hoover (hooveram@ornl.gov): emphasis on ring simulations
* Kiersten Ruisard (ruisardkj@ornl.gov): emphasis on linac simulations

## Codes

We have particular interest in benchmarking codes to model high-intensity beam dynamics. Examples:

* [PyORBIT](https://github.com/PyORBIT-Collaboration/PyORBIT3)
* [ImpactX](https://github.com/BLAST-ImpactX/impactx)
* [Xsuite](https://github.com/xsuite/)
